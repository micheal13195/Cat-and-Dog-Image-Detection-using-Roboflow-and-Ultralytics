## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a YOLO-based model that help to determine if an image is dog or cat.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection and Annotation

- **Image Upload**: Collected images were uploaded to [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
- **Annotation**: Each image was manually annotated in Roboflow to label dogs and cats.

### 2. Dataset Preparation in Ultralytics

- **Dataset Export**: The annotated dataset was exported in YOLO format.
- **Data Import**: This dataset was prepared for use in Ultralytics YOLO8.

### 3. Model Training in Google Colab

- **Model Setup**: YOLO8 from Ultralytics was configured on Google Colab.
- **Training**: The model was trained with optimized parameters to improve detection accuracy.
- **Testing**: Used test images to evaluate the model, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores.

### 4. Testing and Evaluation

- Additional test images were loaded to assess the model’s accuracy in detecting and classifying dogs and cats.

## Results

The trained YOLO8 model achieved reliable accuracy on the test set.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Ultralytics YOLO8
- Roboflow (for annotation)
